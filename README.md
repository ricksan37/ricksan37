## Hi there 👋

Hi everyone, I’m kicking off my Data Analyst journey!

After selling (beautiful!) clothes for several years, managing retail stores, and selling payment solutions from France 🇫🇷 to Italy 🇮🇹 (oh yes 🤌), I am now discovering Data (apparently it’s always capitalized 🫡) through a work-study program.

I'm also taking courses on DataCamp to sharpen my skills.
